# Shared folders for Qubes OS

**Connect qube storage to another qube.**  Access and manage folders
saved in one qube (or a file server connected to it) from another
qube, transparently, as they were in the other qube.

We have some [to-do items](./TODO.md) which we'd love your help with!

## Principle

The programs in this project collaborate together to allow a qube
to *mount* a folder in another qube, using the Plan 9 file system
as a transport mechanism, with `qfsd` (a Rust-based Plan 9 userspace
server, built within this project) running on the server qube, and
the `v9fs` kernel file system module on the client qube.  These two
components communicate with each other via the Qubes RPC mechanism.

## Usage

The following instructions assume that the qube which contains the
files you want to share is named `server` and the qube where you
want to access the files is named `client`.  They also assume you
successfully finished the one-time installation instructions below.

### Connect to a folder in another qube

To mount `/home/user` from the `server` VM onto `/home/user/mnt`,
run the following on a terminal of `client`:

```
cd /home/user
mkdir mnt
qvm-mount-folder server /home/user mnt
```

At this point you will see an authorization message from dom0 asking
you if you really want to give `client` access to `server`'s files.

![Authorization dialog example](./doc/auth-dialog.png)

This access can be denied one-time or perpetually, and it can also
be granted one-time (for the duration of the mount) or permanently.
Note that the access granted is limited to the requested folder and
all subfolders (modulo file permissions on the shared folder) and,
once granted, access lasts until the `server` qube is shut off, or
the `client` qube unmounts the shared folder.

Authorize the access by confirming the name of the qube (`server`) on
the dialog and continuing.

**Presto.**  You should be able to use a file manager, a terminal, or
any of your favorite applications to use files in `/home/user/mnt`
-- these files are all stored in `server` on folder `/home/user`.

### Disconnect from the folder

To finish using it, run `sudo umount /home/user/mnt`.

### In case of error

If your `server` qube shuts off before you unmount the mounted share,
you'll see `I/O error`s on the `client` qube whenever you attempt
to access the mounted share.  You can always unmount the errored
folder to resolve the issue.

### Manage file shares

Your dom0 has a settings tool called *Folder share manager*
(`qvm-folder-share-manager`) that allows you to define or revoke
*permanent* grants or denials on particular file shares:

![Authorization dialog example](./doc/folder-share-manager.png)

Temporary one-time grants or denials are handled internally, not
persisted for long (they are ephemeral) and they cannot be modified
through this settings tool.

Note that grants and denial do not automatically translate into
qubes auto-mounting folders on boot -- they are merely permissions
— you need to figure out how to mount folders when your qube powers
on, using the XDG autostart facility.

## Comparison with other solutions

* File copy/move between VMs: serves a different use case, although
  admittedly it is more secure than this solution given the smaller
  attack surface.
* `rsync` via qrexec / `qubes.ConnectTCP`: large codebase to trust,
  plus extremely inconvenient compared to a simple mounted file share,
  as the user has to (1) configure low-level settings (2) manage the
  synchronization manually (3) take care to remember to sync up.
* Syncthing: in principle, it can work to synchronize across qubes,
  as well as other equipment.  However, it requires networking,
  it's a large codebase, and it results in duplication of files
  across all synced qubes.
* NFS / SAMBA shared over `qubes.ConnectTCP`: this solution is much
  simpler, because it requires zero configuration.  This solution
  should also, by some metrics, be less risky than NFS and SAMBA,
  which are both much larger codebases with many more features that
  you are simply *not going to need* in the context of sharing files
  between qubes.
* NFS / SAMBA mounted from a NAS: this solution is much simpler than
  that, and — unlike mounting a NAS share on the target VM — it
  requires neither other equipment nor a LAN to work properly.
  Furthermore, since NAS solutions obligate you to setup and manage
  authentication and authorization for specific folders, this ends
  up discouraging you from adopting "one share + one mount per qube",
  which reduces your overall security.  Plus, if a qube with access
  to the share is compromised, then the whole NAS may be attacked
  from the compromised qube.

For comparison:

* `qfsd` a few dozen lines, plus 1300 lines for the server portion
  of the Rust `rust-p9` library, plus 1600 lines for the protocol
  portion of the `rust-p9` library.
* `samba` raw C / C++ language line count: **over 2 million**
* NFS' and rsync's line counts are homework for the reader.

## Design

When authorized, the client qube initiates a Qubes RPC connection to
the server qube, asking it to share a specific folder (which must
exist).  If the RPC mechanism authorizes it (by prompting you), then
the server qube starts a `qfsd` instance, and the client uses the
established I/O channel to mount the shared folder onto a folder of
its file system tree.

The full design is documented [here](./doc/authorization-design.md).

## Security considerations

* A compromise of the client qube could be used to escalate into a
  compromise of the `qfsd` daemon running on the server qube -- in
  which case the server qube can be considered compromised.  The
  converse case is possible as well.  Admittedly, this is hard because
  the server is written in a memory-safe language.
* A compromise of the server qube (and therefore `qfsd`) could be used
  to exploit the kernel of any client qubes.  In other words: the client
  qube trusts that `qfsd` (on the server) will not send malicious data
  back to the `v9fs` kernel module of the client.

These are inherent risks of running a client/server setup that uses a
low-level binary protocol and two sides (a client and a server), whether
it be Git, SSH, or any other protocol.

If these security considerations cannot be accommodated by your
security model, you are better off *not using this program*.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the various components is via pre-built RPM
packages.  The packages are available for download here:

* Fedora templates:
  * 38: https://repo.rudd-o.com/unstable/fc38/packages/
  * 39: https://repo.rudd-o.com/unstable/fc39/packages/
  * 40: https://repo.rudd-o.com/unstable/fc40/packages/
  * 41: https://repo.rudd-o.com/unstable/fc41/packages/
* Qubes OS dom0:
  * 4.2: https://repo.rudd-o.com/unstable/q4.2/packages/
  * 4.1: packages aren't built for Qubes OS 4.1 anymore.

Download and install to your template:

* the latest `qubes-shared-folders` `x86_64` package

Download and install to your dom0:

* the latest `qubes-shared-folders-dom0` `noarch` package

Shut off your template qube and restart any qubes you plan to share folders
to or from.

*In the future, the signature for the built RPM packages will be made
available to the public.  For now, you must trust that the package server
is under my control.*

If your only option is to build from source, please see the [building from
source instructions](doc/building-from-source.md).
